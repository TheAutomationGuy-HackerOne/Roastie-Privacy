    <h1>Privacy Policy for Roast Cooking Planner</h1>
    <p class="updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 17, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Roast Cooking Planner ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.</p>
    <p><strong>The short version:</strong> We don't collect, store, or share any of your personal data. Everything stays on your device.</p>

        <li>Usage analytics or behavioral data</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>What Stays On Your Device</h3>
    <p>All app data is stored locally on your device and, if you enable iCloud, synced through Apple's secure infrastructure:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meal Plans:</strong> Your cooking schedules and meal configurations</li>
        <li><strong>Menu Selections:</strong> Dishes you've added to your meals</li>
        <li><strong>App Preferences:</strong> Settings like notification preferences and voice announcement toggles</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Items:</strong> Any custom dishes you create</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <h3>Local Storage</h3>
    <p>All data is stored locally on your device using industry-standard secure storage methods. This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to export or share it.</p>

    <h3>iCloud Sync</h3>
    <p>If you have iCloud enabled on your device, your meal plans may sync across your Apple devices using Apple's iCloud infrastructure. This sync is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Encrypted end-to-end by Apple</li>
        <li>Governed by Apple's Privacy Policy</li>
        <li>Controlled entirely by your iCloud settings</li>
        <li>Not accessible to us in any way</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not have access to your iCloud data. For more information about iCloud security, please visit <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <h3>We Do Not Share Your Data</h3>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your personal information with third parties. Period.</p>

    <h3>User-Initiated Sharing</h3>
    <p>The App provides features that allow YOU to share your data if you choose:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>CSV Export:</strong> Export your meal plans to CSV files</li>
        <li><strong>Share via Messages:</strong> Share meal summaries or shopping lists via iMessage, email, or other apps</li>
        <li><strong>Copy to Clipboard:</strong> Copy text for use in other applications</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These sharing actions are entirely initiated and controlled by you. We have no access to or record of what you share.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <h3>Services We DON'T Use</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Analytics services (Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, etc.)</li>
        <li>Advertising networks</li>

        <li>Crash reporting services that collect personal data</li>
        <li>User behavior tracking tools</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Apple Services</h3>
    <p>The App uses the following Apple-provided services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Local notifications to alert you about cooking events. These are processed entirely on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Speech Synthesis:</strong> Text-to-speech for voice announcements. This is processed on-device.</li>
        <li><strong>iCloud (Optional):</strong> For syncing data across your devices if you enable it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These services are governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13. Since we don't collect personal data from any users, we are compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar regulations worldwide.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your data is protected by your device's security features (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID)</li>
        <li>Your data is encrypted using iOS's built-in encryption</li>
        <li>If you use iCloud sync, your data is protected by Apple's enterprise-grade security</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We recommend:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Keeping your device software up to date</li>
        <li>Using a strong device passcode</li>
        <li>Enabling Find My iPhone for device recovery</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <h3>Data Access and Portability</h3>
    <p>You can access all your data directly within the App. You can export your data at any time using the CSV export feature.</p>

    <h3>Data Deletion</h3>
    <p>To delete your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Delete individual meal plans within the App</li>
        <li>Or uninstall the App to remove all local data</li>
        <li>If using iCloud sync, manage your iCloud data through your device's Settings</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data Control</h3>
    <p>You have complete control over your data. We cannot access, view, or recover your data because it exists only on your device.</p>

    <h2>International Users</h2>
    <p>The App works the same way regardless of where you are located. Since we don't collect or transfer any data, there are no cross-border data transfer concerns. Your data stays on your device, wherever your device is.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:</p>

        <li>Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy</li>
        <li>Posting the new Privacy Policy on this page</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
